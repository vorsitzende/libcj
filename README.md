# LIBCJ
OS-agnostic general purpose routines optimized for i386.  Designed for
interoperability with C/C++.

These would probably fit really nicely into a homebrew OS or embedded system
with memory constraints.

## Currently Implemented Functions
- `itoa()` - Converts a given value to an ASCII string.

- `strlen()` - Counts the number of bytes in a C-style string.

- `strcmp()` - Compares two strings.

- `memcpy()` - Copies a number of bytes of memory from one location to another.

- `memset()` - Writes a value incrementally to a given memory location a number of times.
